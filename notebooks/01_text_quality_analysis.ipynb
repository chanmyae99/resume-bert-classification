The customers spending ranges from online shopping, medical expenses in hospitals, cash transactions, and debit card usage etc. the behavior allows the bank to create an analytical report and based on which the bank used to display the product offers on the customer portal which was built using java. The portal allows the customers to login and see their transactions which they make on a day to day basis .the analytics also help the customers plan their budgets through the budget watch and my financial forecast applications embedded into the portal.

The main objective of the project is to build a Development Data Repository for Pfizer Inc. Because all the downstream application are like Etrack, TSP database, RTS, SADMS, GFS, GDO having their own sql request on the OLTP system directly due to which the performance of OLTP system goes slows down. For this we have created a Development Data Repository to replace the entire sql request directly on the OLTP system. DDR process extracts all clinical, pre-clinical, study, product, subject, sites related information from the upstream applications like EPECS, CDSS, RCM, PRC, E-CLINICAL, EDH and after applying some business logic put it into DDR core tables. From these snapshot and dimensional layer are created which are used for reporting application.\\r\\n\\r\\nRole & Responsibilities:\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u009d\\u0096 To understand & analyze the requirement documents and resolve the queries.\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u009d\\u0096 To design Informatica mappings by using various basic transformations like Filter, Router, Source qualifier, Lookup etc and advance transformations like Aggregators, Joiner, Sorters and so on.\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u009d\\u0096 Perform cross Unit and Integration testing for mappings developed within the team.
