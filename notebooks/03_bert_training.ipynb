customers to avail different products of the bank through analyzing their expenditure behavior the customers spending ranges from online shopping medical expenses in hospitals cash transactions and debit card usage etc the behavior allows the bank to create an analytical report and based on which the bank used to display the product offers on the customer portal which was built using java the portal allows the customers to login and see their transactions which they make on a day to day basis the analytics also help the customers plan their budgets through the budget watch and my financial forecast applications embedded into the portal the portal used hadoop framework to analyes the data as per the rules and regulations placed by the regulators from the respective countries the offers and the interest rates also complied with the regulations and all these processing was done using the hadoop framework as big data analytics system role responsibilities import data from legacy system

based on the open source s w hadoop the data will be stored in hadoop file system and processed using map reduce jobs which in trun includes getting the raw html data from the micro websites process the html to obtain product and user information extract various reports out of the vistor tracking information and export the information for further processing role responsibilities move all crawl

pfizer inc because all the downstream application are like etrack tsp database rts sadms gfs gdo having their own sql request on the oltp system directly due to which the performance of oltp system goes slows down for this we have created a development data repository to replace the entire sql request directly on the oltp system ddr process extracts all clinical pre clinical study product subject sites related information from the upstream applications like epecs cdss rcm prc e clinical edh and after applying some business logic put it into ddr core tables from these snapshot and dimensional layer are created which are used for reporting application role responsibilities to understand analyze the requirement documents and resolve the queries to design informatica mappings by using various basic transformations like filter router source qualifier lookup etc and advance transformations like aggregators joiner sorters and so on perform cross unit and integration testing for mappings developed within the team reporting bugs and bug fixing create workflow batches and set the session dependencies implemented change data capture using mapping parameters scd and sk generation
